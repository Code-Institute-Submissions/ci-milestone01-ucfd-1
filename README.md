# CodeInstitute Milestone Project 1
##### Code Institute / User-Centric Front-End Development

I was tasked with building a static website with at least 3 pages. My vision for my first milestone project has always been a personal portfolio website designed to present me in the best light and get me hired. I know that I will have to write one eventually, so this milestone project presents a good opportunity to build the initial version now. 


## Design
### Wireframe

### Frameworks
**CSS GRID & FLEXBOX** - During some of the training modules, we focused on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but I personally prefer CSS Grid and Flexbox, which I've been learning from all over the internet, and have used to create the [Love-Running](https://github.com/jakubdonovan/Love-Running) mini-project.
