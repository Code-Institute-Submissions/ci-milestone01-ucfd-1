# Personal Portfolio Project
##### Code Institute / User-Centric Front-End Development

I was tasked with building a static website with at least 3 pages. My vision for my first milestone project has always been a personal portfolio website designed to present me in the best light and get me hired. I know that I will have to write one eventually, so this milestone project presents a good opportunity to build the initial version now. 

## Design
### Wireframe

### Frameworks
**CSS GRID & FLEXBOX** - During some of the training modules, we focused on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but I personally prefer CSS Grid and Flexbox, which I've been learning from all over the internet, and have used to create the [Love-Running](https://github.com/jakubdonovan/Love-Running) mini-project.

## Notes
I didn't want to rely on js for the initial version of my portfolio project because I know that I will only be assessed on my use of html and css, but after many hours of trying to come up with css hacks or workarounds to get some elements to work the way I wanted them to,  I realized that some things just couldn't be done elegantly and practically without the use of javascript, so compromises had to be made. Once this initial version of the site has been assessed, I'm going to incorporate a javascript sidebar which resembles that in my initial Adobe XD moqup.
